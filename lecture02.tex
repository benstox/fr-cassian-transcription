\chapter{Praying without ceasing}

\begin{itshape}
Raise up in your Church the Spirit with which our Holy Father St Benedict was animated, so that filled with the same Spirit, we may strive to love what he loved and practise what he taught. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

So we continue our exploration of prayer without ceasing in the Desert Tradition, and then we're going to try and connect that with the Benedictine tradition.

We spoke about explicit prayer and implicit prayer. I'd like to begin with the notion of implicit prayer or a state of prayer. We know from experience that we can't always be praying. We can't always be saying something or thinking something. So to pray without ceasing must mean something more than that. And so perhaps it means a state of prayer which sustains individual moments of prayer.

Cassian uses the term \emph{orationis status}, the state of prayer, and the author that I mentioned to you this morning, Ir\'{e}n\'{e}e Hausherr, he explores the meaning of the Greek term for ``state'' and says that it means putting things in order. It refers to harmony, permanence, rest, firmness in a condition conformed to a thing's nature, a thing's laws and perfection. I like the notion of putting things in order and being in the state that corresponds to your nature. Now, a state can't be something transitory. It can't be isolated events that take place. It has the characteristics rather of a habit or disposition. We could talk about the habit of prayer or the disposition of prayer.

This is the way one of the Desert Fathers describes the habit of prayer or the state of prayer, using the example of wine. ``Wine first goes through a stage of fermentation. This symbolises the age of adolescence, which is a period of excitement, inevitable until maturity and steadiness are attained. Wine does not reach maturity unless the proper amounts of lime and yeast are added and in the same way it is impossible for youth to advance in the practice of self denial unless it receives the proper leaven from a spiritual father in the form of guidance along the right path until God's grace gives him clear vision. People leave wine in a cellar or in a cave until it is perfectly settled.'' --- and the word for settled is the Greek word meaning the state --- ``Likewise, without austerity, \emph{hesychia}'' --- that is stillness --- ``and all sorts of good works, it is not possible to attain to this state.'' So a new wine, newly fermented, needs time to rest and mature to acquire the quality of a fine wine, and the resting of the wine is like a state. And so also in our life of prayer, the initial fervour of youth is wonderful and perhaps we look back on it (well, some of us look back, you look forward or are in it now) as a time of great joy and excitement. But that has to mature and become more profound so that it becomes a state, not just a passing moment of enthusiasm.

The tradition speaks of this state of prayer in other terms. I'd like to single out the whole approach of the ``remembrance of God''. Some spiritual authors, even in the Desert Tradition, have a kind of intellectual view of prayer and are looking for pure prayer and try to eliminate all sorts of distractions and so on, so as to focus and concentrate the mind. But this pure prayer, a state of pure intellectuality (perhaps we could put Evagrius in that category), the vision of the Holy Trinity as it is described, all of that is extremely rare. And if that's the case, then the vast majority of men, even the majority of monks, must give up all hope of attaining union with God in the state of prayer. It seems a little bit too refined. Most of us are kind of ordinary. But in the monastic tradition, in place of such lofty ambitions, the Fathers propose striving for a state which may be more lowly in appearance but is perhaps not inferior in excellence. A state which is generally far more attainable, though it does not lack difficulties of its own. The traditional name for this state is the ``memory of God''. Because that's more accessible, that's what I'd like to focus on.

Even in the pre-Christian philosophical tradition of Philo there's an effort to emphasise preserving the memory of God and never forgetting it. And that phrase sounds very much like the Rule of St Benedict, Chapter 7, on the first degree of humility: ``to flee forgetfulness''. St Benedict puts that at the beginning of this journey of humility, that is to be aware of the presence of God and not to forget it. In fact, to \emph{flee} forgetfulness! You can turn the steps of humility the other way around too and say \emph{this} is the summmit, as opposed to the twelfth degree, that is to be aware of the presence of God at all times, the memory of God at all times. St Benedict doesn't give a systematic treatment of the spiritual life but every now and then there are little hints in the Rule that refer to a whole teaching of the larger tradition and that gives us some insight into what he's talking about. So when he says to flee forgetfulness, that's really the whole theology of the memory of God. Let's see what else the Fathers say about this memory of God.

St Basil talks about this and describes as the goal the ``holy thought of God stamped into our soul like an ineradicable seal'' --- a stamp --- ``by means of a distinct and continual remembrance.'' For St Basil it is perfectly possible to conserve this remembrance in all circumstances, even while doing physical labour. So occupations, for St Basil, outside the time of formal prayer are perfectly compatible with prayer of the heart or even of the lips. They provide opportunities for such prayer, stimulated, and so to speak prepare for it. Well, the Desert Fathers certainly did that with their manual labour, that is, so that they could be working with their hands and be repeating psalm verses or this One Word Prayer at the same time, in order to keep the memory of God even while going about other occupations. For intellectual work that's a bit more difficult, because if you have to study, then your mind has to be focussed on what it is that you're studying and it's harder to keep in mind the memory of God unless it has become a habit or a state as I was saying before.

Let me give a little summary then of what we've said so far. In approaching the Desert Fathers the question I raised is what is necessary for continuous prayer. They all say that they want it. How do we go about it? One of the requirements that we saw was \emph{conversatio}, that is, a way of life or rule of life. A certain ascetic discipline. That's the context in which prayer takes place. A unity between your life of prayer and your other kinds of activity. Then we spoke about explicit moments of prayer or kinds of prayer: gestures, verbal prayer, psalms (and the psalms will be the link with the Divine Office), the alternating of prayer and memorisation and psalmody, we spoke briefly about secret meditation, that is the interior work that is done for Lectio Divina, the rumination over a scriptural text, and this One Word Prayer, that Cassian talks about, which I will say more about later on this week. All those are explicit kinds of prayer. Then briefly we've looked at implicit prayer, that is, what we really hope for and desire, aside from individual moments of prayer and individual styles of prayer: a habit of prayer or a state of prayer, which is like a mature wine and involves the living in the presence of God and having the memory of God always before us.

Those are wonderful ideals. How are they realised in the monastic tradition? I'd like to switch to the Divine Office now and how these monastic ideals are made concrete in the monastic Office, especially but not exclusively as indicated by St Benedict. So we're turning to prayer without ceasing in the Rule of St Benedict and most especially in the Office.

It's interesting that we would think of the Office in terms of prayer without ceasing. It's interesting I say because throughout history it's been looked at in many different ways and frequently it has been considered in the history of spirituality as a burden. As a duty. As something that you have to perform, but your spiritual nourishment is really elsewhere. Over and over again throughout the centuries we've seen that kind of mistaken attitude towards the Office, whereas if we go back to the origins, the Office seems to be a continuation or a making more concrete of this desire to pray without ceasing. The way that that's revealed in the Rule of St Benedict is through symbolic numbers on the one hand and through the \emph{Deus in adjutorium} on the other.

Let me say something about symbolic numbers. You'll find this perhaps odd, but maybe curious enough to be interesting. The ancients liked numbers. And numbers had a symbolic value for them and communicated a great deal more to them than they do to us. And two numbers that are especially significant are seven and twelve. So let's look at the number seven.

As we find it in the Rule of St Benedict, this is chapter 16, the celebration of the Divine Office during the day: ``The prophet says, \emph{Seven times a day have I praised you}. We will fulfill the sacred number of seven if we satisfy our obligations of service'' --- now St Benedict considers the Office an obligation also, the ``officia nostr\ae\ servitutis'' --- ``We will fulfill the sacred number of seven if we satisfy our obligations of service at Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline, for it was of these hours during the day that he said: \emph{Seven times a day have I praised you}. Concerning Vigils, the same prophet says,'' --- we're talking about the psalms, so it's David --- ``\emph{At midnight I arose to give you praise}.'' So that's something separate outside of the number seven in St Benedict's arrangement here. ``Therefore we should praise our Creator for his just judgements at these times.'' Then he repeats himself: ``Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline, and let us arise at night to give him praise.'' Why does St Benedict make a big deal out of this? Well, because seven means totality, completeness, continuous. So if we want to pray without ceasing we have to pray seven times a day. Now you might say, well that's a kind of material way of looking at things, and not very convincing. Well, from an intellectual point of view perhaps it's not very convincing, but from a symbolic point of view it meant a lot to the ancients. Seven times a day means praying without ceasing. Not just the Rule of St Benedict but all kinds of Patristic texts --- I'm thinking of St Gregory in particular, but Augustine and others --- use the number seven in this sense. So the structure of the Office in the Rule of St Benedict is connected to prayer without ceasing by the number seven.

Also by the number twelve. In the Rule, chapter 10. Now the liturgical code in the Rule, for most people, is a little bit dry and dusty. Not too much spiritual juice there. But if you read it carefully there's all sorts of hidden treasures. In chapter 10, verse 3. The topic is the arrangement of the Night Office in summer. And so he talks about the distribution of the psalms and so on. ``In everything else the winter arrangement for Vigils is kept. Thus, winter and summer, there are never fewer than twelve psalms at Vigils, not counting psalms 3 and 94''. What's the big deal about twelve? Well, let's go to Cassian and find out what the big deal is.

This is from the \emph{Institutes} of Cassian, Book 2. And Cassian is describing the origins of monasticism, and for him the origins lie in the \emph{Acts of the Apostles}. But then the enthusiasm and fervour faded away and the monks then are picking up this tradition to live intensely the Apostolic life: ``However, in the early monastic tradition, the Fathers took careful consideration to lay down what the daily prayer for all monks should be. They agreed together to pass on an inheritance of peaceful devotion to their successors, safeguarded from all divisive uncertainty. For they were concerned lest disagreement arise about the daily celebration among men living the common life'' --- liturgical controversy was present then too, nothing new under the sun --- ``lest new variations sow the seeds of future error, jealousy or division. For once it happened that each individual'' --- we're talking about hermits now --- ``without thinking of the weakness of others, made decisions based on his own fervour about the method of prayer he thought ideal for his own faith and ability. He would take no account of what might be possible for the majority of brothers in general among whom, inevitably, a large proportion would be weak. This led to competition, each one attempting to decree an absurd number of psalms as his own strength of mind dictated.'' Now here it gets interesting! ``Some would opt for 50 psalms.'' A day, that is. ``Some 60. Others would even think themselves bound to surpass that number. And instead of a religious rule, they ended up with a pious competition of holy varieties until the time for the sacred celebration of Vespers would be taken up in argument.'' That is, you had hermits meeting for a little council and there was this kind of contest, who was saying the most psalms. St Benedict says in the end of the Rule, you know, we're so tepid and weak and no good today because our Fathers recited the whole Psalter in a single day. Well, that's this kind of context that he's referring to. So there was this meeting of the hermits and they were vying with one another, who was the best because they said the most psalms, and then it was Vesper time so they sat down for Vespers: ``And it happened''
