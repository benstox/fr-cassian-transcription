\chapter{Praying without ceasing}

Raise up in your Church the Spirit with which our Holy Father St Benedict was animated, so that filled with the same Spirit, we may strive to love what he loved and practise what he taught. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

So we continue our exploration of prayer without ceasing in the Desert Tradition, and then we're going to try and connect that with the Benedictine tradition.

We spoke about explicit prayer and implicit prayer. I'd like to begin with the notion of implicit prayer or a state of prayer. We know from experience that we can't always be praying. We can't always be saying something or thinking something. So to pray without ceasing must mean something more than that. And so perhaps it means a state of prayer which sustains individual moments of prayer.

Cassian uses the term \emph{orationis status}, the state of prayer, and the author that I mentioned to you this morning, Ir\'{e}n\'{e}e Hausherr, he explores the meaning of the Greek term for ``state'' and says that it means putting things in order. It refers to harmony, permanence, rest, firmness in a condition conformed to a thing's nature, a thing's laws and perfection. I like the notion of putting things in order and being in the state that corresponds to your nature. Now, a state can't be something transitory. It can't be isolated events that take place. It has the characteristics rather of a habit or disposition. We could talk about the habit of prayer or the disposition of prayer.

This is the way one of the Desert Fathers describes the habit of prayer or the state of prayer, using the example of wine. ``Wine first goes through a stage of fermentation. This symbolises the age of adolescence, which is a period of excitement, inevitable until maturity and steadiness are attained. Wine does not reach maturity unless the proper amounts of lime and yeast are added and in the same way it is impossible for youth to advance in the practice of self denial unless it receives the proper leaven from a spiritual father in the form of guidance along the right path until God's grace gives him clear vision''.

People leave wine in a cellar or in a cave until it is perfectly settled. 

The word for settled is the Greek word for state.
