\chapter{Praying without ceasing}

In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

Let us pray.

Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy Grace into our hearts, that we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may through His Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of His Resurrection. Through the same Christ our Lord.

Well, I'm very happy to be with you again. As we were talking about last night at recreation, there's a long history of connection and friendship which I value very much. It seems strange perhaps that monks need a retreat, but in fact our lives are very busy and rather intense, so a retreat is a wonderful thing in which you can respond to the Lord's invitation to \emph{come away to a quiet place and rest a while}. So I'm sure getting some extra rest is important this week, but also a time to reflect, a kind of review of the past year. And we tend to ask ourselves questions like, where am I in the spiritual life? And what is God doing in my life? What are my preoccupations? What changes do I need to make? Maybe I need to reorient myself, to get back on track. How is my life of prayer? The question that you need to ask God will give you to ask, but we need to ask them.

The topic of the retreat is prayer. It's a general theme suggested by Abbott Xavier in an e-mail to me. He was talking about the relationship between Mass and Office in particular, if I remember correctly. And I was thinking about that, and thought, well, that's crucial but it has to fit into a larger picture, because there's also Lectio, there's private prayer, there's all kinds of other things. We're searching for unity in our spiritual life, not fragmentation. So what I'd like to do, or try to do, is to provide that unifying context in which we can examine more particularly the various aspects of our life of prayer. That's why I gave you this little outline here, so that you'll know where we're going.

The question of prayer, of course, is basic to our life and it's a response to Our Lord. We call the disciples' request of Jesus, ``Lord, teach us how to pray''.  It's very curious the way he goes about responding to that question. And there's a little icon, which describes the scene. A very beautiful one. I'll just pass it around --- show-and-tell --- so you have something to do. But this icon is also in the third part of the Catechism in the section on prayer. That is, each of those four sections has some kind of image from the tradition which summarizes the whole content of that section. And this is the very image that's in the Cathechism in the section on prayer.

The disciples ask Jesus to teach them to pray, so you'd think that he would turn toward them and give them some sort of instruction, and engage them in some sort of dialogue. But he doesn't. In the icon he's not facing the disciples at all. He turns and faces the Father. The Father is pictured up in a little cloud, because the cloud is the symbol of divinity. And he addresses himself to the Father. And the disciples observe that. You can see in the icon they're watching to see what's going on there. And it's a perfect definition of prayer: that is, not something that we do, in the first place, but somehting that we participate in. Prayer is the dialogue between the Father and the Son, and the communion of the Holy Trinity. And we are invited in to that. It's going on quite independently of us. So Whether we pray or not, the Son is praying to the Father. And so, just as in the liturgy, it's not so much something that we do, but the heavenly liturgy, in which we participate. So also in other kinds of prayer, it's the key relationship between the Father and the Son to which we are invited.

So monastic prayer is nothing more than a deepening of this Christian prayer. The fact is that we dedicate time and energy and the orientation of our whole life to prayer. Cassian describes this preoccupation of the monk with the things of God and our desire to participate in the prayer between Jesus and the Father in these words: ``The goal is that we shall see the fulfillment of our Saviour's prayer to the Father for his disciples''. And he quotes John's Gospel, ``May the love with which you have loved me,'' Jesus says to the Father, ``be in them and they in us. May they be one in you, Father, as you are in me and I am in you''. That they also may be one in us. So this communion with the Trinity is the goal of our prayer. This perfect love with which God has first loved us will come about in our hearts through the fulfillment of this prayer of the Lord. And our faith tells us that his prayer cannot be in vain. So what's key is the prayer of `Christ. These are the signs that will accompany the fulfillment, the signs in us. God will be our whole love and desire. Our whole study and labour. Our whole thought, our whole life. Our speaking. Our breathing. The unity which exists between the Father and the Son will be communicated to our souls and emotions. Just as God loves us with a true and pure and unfailing charity, so we will be united to him with the indissoluble unity of constant love. We will be so attached to him that our whole yearning and thinking and speaking will be about him alone. So the life of prayer to which we aspire is something that embraces us in a total kind of way.

I'd like to being with  the desert tradition because the retreat is entitile Prayer in the Monastic Tradition and the Desert Tradition is where we get the beginnings of this kind of theology of preayer that will be developed in the later tradition. Now the Desert Tradition doesn't only mean Egypt, it also includes Palestine and Syria and Asia Minor. It's that whole area. But anyways, those first few centuries of monastic experience.

The Desert Fathers were really concerned with the Gospel injunction to pray without ceasing. In Luke 18, the parable about the pesty widow who molests the judge with her constant petitions, the beginning of that parable says, the Lord gave the parable so that we would learn to pray without ceasing and never give up. Also in 1 Thessalonians 5:17, St Paul lists a number of desirable qualities: \emph{rejoice always and pray without ceasing}. We know that the desert fathers took this seriously, and there are some wonderful stories that describe this, so I'll be telling a lot of stories in this first conference. They're more interesting anyway. First, about Arsenius: ``Having withdrawn to the solitary life, Arsenius made this prayer: `Lord, lead me in the way of salvation'. And he heard a voice saying to him, `Arsenius, flee, be silent, pray always, for these are the sources of sinlessness'''. So part of the vocation of Arsenius is to pray without ceasing. There's another Desert Father, Benjamin, who talks about the same thing. ``As he was dying, Abba Benjamin said to his sons, `If you observe the following you can be saved,''' and he quotes 1 Thessalonians 5, ```\emph{be joyful at all times, pray without ceasing, and give thanks for all things}'''.

This ideal of praying without ceasing is very attractive, but how can we achieve it? It's one thing to present the ideal, it's another thing to get there. We're familiar with the story of the Russian pilgrim, \emph{The Way of the Pilgrim}, which popularised the Jesus prayer, and you might recall that at the beginning of this pilgrim's search he was looking for a wise, old man who could tell him how to pray without ceasing. And he heard that there was a certain hermit living on a country estate and he went and found him and said, ```I beg you in God's name to explain to me the hidden meaning of the Apostle's words, \emph{pray without ceasing}. How is it possible to pray continually?' The man gazed at me for a long time before speaking.'' There's a certain reluctance to explain these intimante
